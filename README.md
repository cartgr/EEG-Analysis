# EEG-Analysis
The goal of this project is to build a classifier that will allow one to control the cursor with a muse headband.

### Setup
In order to stream data from my Muse-2, I am using [Petal Metrics](https://petal.tech/metrics-api). Once the Muse headband has been connected via 
the Petal API, the stream can be tapped into as is done in lslStream.py.

### Classifiers
This is one of my first porjects using AutoKeras
